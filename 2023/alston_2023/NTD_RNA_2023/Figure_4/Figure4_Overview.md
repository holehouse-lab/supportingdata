Figure 4. Orthologous nucleocapsid proteins show similar bound-state ensembles despite variation in RBD surface charge residues and NTD sequence. 

A. 
Scaling maps quantify the average inter-residue distance between NTD residues (X-axis) and NTD or RBD residues (Y-axis) in the bound state. Heatmap values are calculated by calculating the average inter-residue distance in the RNA-bound state and diving that distance by the average inter-residue distance in the RNA unbound state. Blue colors report on inter-residue distances that are closer together in the bound state while red colors report on inter-residue distances that are further apart in the unbound state. In all six orthologs, the NTD is closer to the Î²-extension in the bound state, reporting on the formation of a positive fuzzy groove in the bound state.

B. 
Regions closer to the NTD in the RNA-bound state are highlighted on the SCO2 RBD structure in blue, while regions that are further apart from the NTD in RNA-bound state are shown in red.
This figure was made by summing across the x axis in the Summed Interaction distance map and using the crossover regions of closer and further interaction to determine coloring for SCO2 NTDRBD
