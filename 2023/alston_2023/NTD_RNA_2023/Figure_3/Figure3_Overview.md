Figure 3. Charge clustering determines the affinity-enhancement provided by he SARS-CoV-2 NTD

A.
Schematic showing the wiltype and tiling mutants that systematically reposition residues 30-50 from the wildtype sequence. 

B. 
Binding affinity for tiling mutants schematisized in panel A. Tiling mutant T6 and T11 show wildtype-like binding affinity, whereas all other variants show binding affinity less than the wildtype.
-Binding was calculated as in Figure 2.
-Plot of Data was generated as in Plotting.ipynb

C. Graphical schematic highlighting the positively-charged “fuzzy groove” that can form upon RNA binding between the positively-charged beta extension on the RBD and the cluster of positively charged residues on the NTD.

D. Binding affinities for 172 scramble variants. Each variant reports on the binding affinity for an NTD-RBD construct, where for each variant the NTD sequence was randomly scrambled. Despite having identical amino acid composition, sequence order enables a four-order-of-magnitude change in binding affinity, highlighting the importance of sequence in dictating binding affinity
-Binding was calculated as in Figure 2.
-All sequences were read in using Soursop directly from each simulation and Saved to a folder Called Sequences

E. 
Scramble sequences plotted with binding affinity vs. the average position of positively-charged residues disrtibuted across the sequence. For positional bins, average binding affinity is shown as a blue circle. Individual points are colored based on the IWD+ score, which reports on the clustering of positively charged residues (darker colors = more highly clustered).

F. 
Same data as shown in E, with additional set of scrambles designed to cluster positively charged residues. Average binding affinity of this second set is shown as black circles.
