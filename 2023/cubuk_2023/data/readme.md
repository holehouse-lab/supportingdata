# README

This directory contains most of the data used for making figures in the paper, as well as some additional data

## Content

* `/COM_trajectories` contain center of mass trajectories for NTD-RBD + different length RNA molecules. These are used when calculating binding affinities. Note all the actual COM distances for each trajectory are shared in the Zenodo repo.

* `/bound_and_unbound_trajectories` contains a movie and not much else, although bound and unbound trajectory files could be put here to enable analysis

* `rna_protein_contacts` contains raw data for a large number of the protein:RNA contact analyses shown in the supplementary figures and in Fig. 5B.
