# `Bound_and_unbound_trajectories`
The trajectories here report on pre-divided bound and unbound trajectories of NTD-RBD + (rU)25 and are provided as representative trajectories.

Note that to actually download the trajectories, you should get these from the Zenodo repository (link in main README file)

They are used for generating representative figures by the `com_trajectory_figure.ipynb`
