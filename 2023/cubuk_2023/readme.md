## Contents:

* `/data` - A subset of the data used for the analysis in the paper
* `/figure_5` - all code for generating all panels of Figure 5.
* `/figure_9D` - all code for generating Fig. 9D
*  `misc/` - directory for miscellaneous stuff, including `build_files.sh` which shows how the shared Zenodo trajectory deposition file is built.
* `/smFRET` - contains data for smFRET binding experiments

* **Fig. S11B**: Generated by  `figure_5/panel_contactmap/protein_RNA_interaction.ipynb` (or, specifically, color file for VMD generated here, and then molecular structure generated and saved in `supplementary_figures/structure_annotation` (the `mapped.pdb` should have the coloring used here as the BETA column in the PDB file).
* **Fig. S12**: Generated by `supplementary_figures/RNA_length_vs_protein_interaction.ipynb`

## Simulation setup
All Mpipi simulations were run using LAMMPS with input files and settings identical to those provided in the original [Mpipi implementation](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Code_and_Data_for_Physics-driven_coarse-grained_model_for_biomolecular_phase_separation_with_near-quantitative_accuracy_/16772812). 

## Simulation trajectories
We provide full trajectories of all simulations discussed in this paper at the following Zenodo repository:
[https://zenodo.org/record/7631327](https://zenodo.org/record/7631327).

If you plan to use these simulations for future scientific exploration please let us know, as we are continuing to follow up on our initial manuscript. 

## Software requirements:
#### OS requirements
The sequence analyses have been tested on the following systems:

* **macOS**: Monterey (12.3.1) and Monterey (12.3.1)
* **Linux**: Ubuntu 18.04

#### Python dependencies
Our notebooks use standard Python scientific tools:

* numpy - [installation guidelines](https://numpy.org/install/)
* scipy - [installation guidelines](https://scipy.org/install/)
* matplotlib - [installation guidelines](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)
* pandas - [installation guidelines](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
* seaborn - [installation guidelines](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)


Additionally, you they also require [mdtraj](https://mdtraj.org/), and [soursop](https://soursop.readthedocs.io/) 

* **mdtraj** can be installed through conda 

		conda install mdtraj # requires conda-forge

* While **soursop** can be installed using `pip` once mdtraj has been installed:

		pip install soursop
