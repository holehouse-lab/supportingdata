# Figure 5
The notebooks in this directory fully reproduce the figures and panels in figure 5.

Note that the file `build_re_track.ipynb` constructs the file `shprd_re_vector_track.tsv`, but we do provide a compressed version (`shprd_re_vector_track.tsv.tgz`) so that all figures can be rebuilt without needing to recompute the proteome-wide re vectors!
