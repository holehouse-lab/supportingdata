        "This notebook will let you compute what fraction of proteins have disordered regions using a FASTA file of full-length protein sequences as input.\n",
        "\n",
        "NOTE: The setup cell (Step 1) takes ~1-2 minutes to run (sorry!) but then the actual disorder prediction will take very very few seconds.\n",
        "\n",
        "## OUTPUT\n",
        "This notebook JUST prints out the fraction of proteins with disordered regions (and the associated count), as well as average, min, and max fraction disorder and number of disordered residues. More sophisticated analysis probably necessitates some more involved informatics!\n",
