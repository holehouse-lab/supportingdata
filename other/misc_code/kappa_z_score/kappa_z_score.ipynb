    "# Calculating kappa Z-scores\n",
    "###### Last updated 2022-07-05\n",
    "\n",
    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook requires the package `localcider` and implements a simplified version of the approach defined in Cohan and Shinn et al. *JMB* (2022) and is similar to the approach used in Martin et al. *Science* (2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "If this code is used **please cite Cohan & Shinn et al (2022)** (reference below).\n",
    "\n",
    "For an excruciating dive into $\\kappa$, $\\delta$, and some of the underlying theory there, I recommend both the original Das & Pappu 2013 PNAS paper and Holehouse et al. 2017 Biophys. J. (specifically the supplementary information - make sure you have coffee and/or a stiff drink at your side...).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook defines two functions. To compute the Z-score on your sequence of interest simply run:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    seq = # defines a valid amino acid sequence\n",
    "    \n",
    "    get_kappa_zscore(seq)\n",
    "    \n",
    "And the underlying Z-score will be returned. That's it. No magic. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "To run this notebook simply install the localcider Python package using `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install localcider\n",
    "    \n",
    "And then run this notebook using Juypter. We strongly recommend doing this within a controlled conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "> NB: If you're not familiar with conda and its role in Python environment configuration, [we recommend reading up on this first before continuing](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Help with this code\n",
    "This code was written by Alex Holehouse as a generic implementation for calculating kappa-based Z-scores using the $\\delta$ distribution instead of the $\\kappa$ distribution (where $\\kappa = \\delta / \\delta_{max}$, so using $\\delta$ instead of $\\kappa$ gives you the same value in terms of a Z-score).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, this is exactly the same approach as NARDINI uses - here we just expose the inner workings! As mentioned - IF this code is used please cite the NARDINI paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions please don't hesitate to [reach out to me](https://www.holehouselab.com/).\n",
