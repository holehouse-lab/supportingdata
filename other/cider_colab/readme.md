## About
This notebook implements the sequence analysis functionality of the [CIDER webserver](http://pappulab.wustl.edu/CIDER/analysis/) in case it goes offline and/or runs into sequence length limitations. 

Also, the colab notebook can analyze arbitrarily large numbers of sequences, although we'd suggest if you're doing large-scale sequence analysis our [ALBATROSS-associated colab notebooks](https://github.com/holehouse-lab/ALBATROSS-colab) are probably better suited.
