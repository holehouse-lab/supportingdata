* `cross_interaction_calvados.pkl` - all possible heterotypic interactions as computed by the CALVADOS model.
* `cross_interaction_mpipi.pkl` - all possible heterotypic interactions as computed by the Mpipi-GG model.

Note - the `.pkl` files are not in the GitHub repo because they are ~450 MBs each but are in the Zenodo repository.
