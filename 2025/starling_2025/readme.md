### Manuscript timeline and relationship to this repository
This manuscript was preprinted and submitted in February 2025. Reviews were received in May 2025, and a revised version was resubmitted (but not updated as a preprint, in compliance with the publisher's requirements) in October 2025. However, STARLING itself has been completely updated as part of the revision process, moving from a UNet-based architecture in the diffusion model to a Vision Transformer. The notebooks in this repository reflect the revised version. We are happy to share our revised version of the manuscript with people - please just email alex (alex dot holehouse at wustl dot edu) and he can share it!
