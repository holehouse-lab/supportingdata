# About
This directory contains head-to-head comparisons of performance and predicted ensemble properties for two state-of-the-art IDP ensemble generation methods.

For both methods, we attempted to predict ensembles for the set of 133 sequences in our STARLING comparison dataset; however, memory limitations restricted us to ~200-250 amino acid IDRs. This yielded ~100 ensembles generated with the two methods.

It is worth noting that both methods provide _all atom_ ensembles, as opposed to STARLING's coarse-grained ensembles. It's also worth noting that all of these methods offer innovative machine learning approaches and solutions to a complex problem, and do so using distinct and interesting approaches.

* NB: The preprint version is now substantially out of date compared to our resubmitted version. However, the main version on [GitHub](https://github.com/idptools/starling/) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/idptools-starling/) has all the new features.

## Other methods
While we did not compare against it directly, it's worth noting that – to our knowledge – the [two-stage denoising-diffusion approach developed by Taneja and Lasker](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-3495(23)04121-8) predates all other work using DDPMs for IDP ensemble generation, and established the technical feasibility of this general type of approach.

Finally, Janson et al. preprinted their [IDPGan model in June 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.18.496675v1), which was published in Feb. 2023, and offered key proof of concept for training on simulation data. We compare accuracy against IDPGan elsewhere in this GitHub directory.

## Directory structure
The directory structure here is organized as follows:

* `starling/` - data and results used for STARLING benchmarks
* `idpforge/` - data and results used for IDPForge benchmarks
* `idpfold/` - data and results used for IDPFold benchmarks
* `idpsam/` - data and results used for IDPSam benchmarks
* `unet_vs_vit/` - Not included in the publication, but our original STARLING implementation used a UNet in the DDPM, whereas in our revised version, we rebuilt and retrained with a vision transformer. This directory compares the accuracy between these two versions.
* `three_way_performance_comparison.ipynb` - contains code for comparing across IDPFold, IDPForge and STARLING
* `figures/` - contains figures generated by `three_way_performance_comparison.ipynb`.
