# About
The directories here contain outputs from benchmarking runs performed on different hardware setups. Benchmarking runs were done using `starling-benchmark`, either executed natively or run using the shell scripts provided here.

Note that benchmark the compile flags this must be done in a notebook to ensure that warm up runs are done.
