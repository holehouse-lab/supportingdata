# IDPFold ensembles

IDPFold lets you generate ensembles with one of two options: `all_delta` and `minus_1`. We generated ensembles with both. Sequences for the Schuler linker sequences (as single PDB trajectories) are provided here under. 

	all_delta/
	minus_1/
	
TO BE ADDED: PDB files for the SAXS comparisons.
