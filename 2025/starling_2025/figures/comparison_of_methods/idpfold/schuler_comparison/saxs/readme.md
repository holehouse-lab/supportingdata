# SAXS scattering comparison
This directory conatins SAXS data used in a 1:1:1 comparison for the SAXS data associated with the Schuler linker sequences.


* `/experiment_saxs` contains processed scattering curves for the four Schuler sequences where scattering data are available.
* `/idpfold_saxs` contains four subdirectories, where each subdirectory contains the IDPFold ensemble and the predicted scattering curve derived from that ensemble (`average_curve.dat`). 
* `starling_saxs/` contains four subdirectories, where each subdirectory contains just the predicted scattering curve derived from the associated STARLING ensemble (`average_curve.dat`)



**NB:** For the STARLING and IDPFold directories, there are some other files in here: `average_curve_error.dat`, `average_curve_noise.dat`, and `logfile_autoSCRT.txt` - these are just default files generated by our in-house SAXS curve calculation pipeline and can be ignored.
