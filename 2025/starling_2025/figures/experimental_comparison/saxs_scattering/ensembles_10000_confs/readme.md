# About
This directory houses 13 sets of .starling/.xtc/.pdb files for LARGE ensembles, where we want nice smooth histograms for plotting. 

Note that ensembles in here are also reproduced at a smaller size in `../ensembles/` directory

Ensembles were generated with:

	starling big_ensemble_seqs.fasta -c 10000
