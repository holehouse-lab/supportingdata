# Data

This directory contains the cleaned data used for each of the figures in the manuscript. Data is divided into subfolders based on the PARROT analyses it is associated with (phosphosite, activation_domain, or ab_nucleation).

Also included in this directory is a jupyter-notebook file (`plot_PARROT_analyses.ipynb`) that has code for creating each of the figures in the manuscript.
