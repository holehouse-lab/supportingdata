## Running simulations
Simulations were run as detailed in the Methods. 

[CAMPARI can be installed from here](http://campari.sourceforge.net/). We ran simulations using CAMPARI 2.0 because this work was done many years ago, so, if you run similar simulations in the future we recommend CAMPARI 4.0. 

In this directory we include a `run.key` which is a keyfile that matches the input parameters to the ones originally used.

For each sequence, 15 independent simulations were run.
