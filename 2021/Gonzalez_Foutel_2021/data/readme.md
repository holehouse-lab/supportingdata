## Preamble
Sub-selected trajectories for each of the simulations reported. Full trajectories are available on request for the simple reason that they're quite big and loading them all onto GitHub or Zenodo is really time-consuming. However, as soon as we get a request for the full trajectories we'll upload (and please don't be shy about asking!).

That said, sub-selected trajectories are built by uniformly sampling from the full trajectories and provide a good if more sparse representation of the underlying conformational ensemble.

## Running simulations
Simulations were run as detailed in the Methods. 

[CAMPARI can be installed from here](http://campari.sourceforge.net/). We ran simulations using CAMPARI 2.0 because this work was done many years ago, so, if you run similar simulations in the future we recommend CAMPARI 4.0. 

In this directory we include a `run.key` which is a keyfile similar to the one originally used.


## Data
Trajectory data are provided as a `full.pdb` and `full.xtc` in an appropriate directory.
