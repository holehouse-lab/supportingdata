Contains data for disorder prediction.


### `/drosophila`
Consensus predicted IDRs from _Drosophila melongaster (D. melongaster)_ and the associated *D. melongaster* proteome. 

### `/p_body_proteins`
Consensus predicted IDRs P body proteins taken from _Drosophila melongaster (D. melongaster)_ along with the actual protein sequences and per-residue disorder scores as computed by both [MobiDB-LITE](protein.bio.unipd.it/mobidblite/) and [metapredict](https://pypi.org/project/metapredict/)
