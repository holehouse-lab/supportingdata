#                                   MONTE CARLO SAMPLER
# ========================================================================================================
#
# This section, defines how our Monte Carlo sampling approach explores the conformational/energetic landscape
#    
# Things you may want to change here; 
# 
# - RIGIDFREQ --> If no ions and a single molecule set this to 0
# - PKRFREQ   --> If no prolines set to 0
# - *STEPSZ   --> Might want to play around with these? In theory, the MC sampling scheme should not affect
#                 the generate ensemble, though in practice it may affect the equilibration time. No hard
#                 rules for how we use these...
#
#
# One key idea is the *RDFREQ keyword;
#
# *RDFREQ      RDFREQ keywords define the fraction of some class of moves which are totally random selections
#              of that parameter vs. a small incremental change to the current value. i.e. CHIRDFREQ=1 means
#              every time we do a CHI move pertubation it's totally independent of the current state, vs. CHIRDFREQ=0
#              means every move CHI move is totally Markovian and does not allow randomization. Both extremes will
#              hurt sampling immensly, but intermediate values are broadly OK.
#
# Feel free to mess with these output parameters to improve performance if you don't care about some analysis 
# type(s).
