This repository contains additional information for the paper:

Cubuk J, Alston JJ, Jeremías Incicco J, Singh S, Stuchell-Brereton MD, Ward MD, et al. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is dynamic, disordered, and phase separates with RNA. Nat Commun. 2021;12: 1–17.

This work is the result of a close collaboration between the Holehouse and Soranno labs, with Andrea and Alex being very much equal co-corresponding authors.

If any information from the paper would be of use please do not hesitate to contact [myself](http://holehouse.wustl.edu/) or [Andrea Soranno](https://sorannolab.wustl.edu/) directly!
