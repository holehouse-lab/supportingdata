This repository contains additional information for the paper:

Cubuk, J., Alston, J.J., Incicco, J.J., Singh, S., Stuchell-Brereton, M.D., Ward, M.D., Zimmerman, M.I., Vithani, N., Griffith, D., Wagoner, J.A., Bowman, G.R., Hall, K.B., Soranno, A., and Holehouse, A.S. (2020). The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is dynamic, disordered, and phase separates with RNA. 

This work is the result of a close collaboration between the Holehouse and Soranno labs, with Andrea and Alex being very much equal co-corresponding authors.

This paper is in press at *Nature Communications*, but an essentially final version [is available on bioRxiv here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.158121v2).
