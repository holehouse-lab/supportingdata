    "The following short code snipped shows how one could predict IDRs from another prediction tool that provides per-residue disorder scores. We're using [ODiNPred](https://st-protein.chem.au.dk/odinpred) as our example because it's GREAT, but, other predictors are out there and could obviously be used in the same way!\n",

Perhaps there's a reason which is predicted to be borderline because it folds on binding a partner (e.g. DNA, RNA, protein, ion *etc.*). In any case, for protein-specific analysis a combination of disorder predictor plus primary literature is generally the best approach to build a high-confidence map of which regions are disordered *in the context you care about*."
