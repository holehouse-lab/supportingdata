# About
This directory contains two files with ChIP scores for various sequences, some viable and some inviable. 

**NB**: The first two values in the viable file are two examples for viable constructs that were measured in the ChIP assay with a plasmid with untagged wt Abf1 in the background, i.e., mimicking the binding competition effect that all inviable constructs have by necessity.
