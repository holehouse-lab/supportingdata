## Contents:

* `/code` contains sequence, preparatory, and analysis code for the transcription factor bioinformatic analysis performed in this paper, and some bonus stuff.

For more information on the files in this directory, please contact [Alex or Dan](http://holehouse.wustl.edu/). For information on the remainder of the paper, please contact [Tim](http://www.timotheelionnet.net/)!

Additional contents can and will be added to this repository as needed. 

## Reproducing analyses & figures:

Parts of the bioinformatic analyses in this manuscript were carried out using the notebooks in `/code` with Python (version 3.7 or 3.8). To reproduce these analyses and figures download this entire repository, and open the Jupyter Notebook `compute_idr_params.ipynb`. 

The code should run directly assuming the required packages are included. For a more detailed discussion of setting up a working conda environment see `code/readme.md`.


### Software requirements:
#### OS requirements
The sequence analyses have been tested on the following systems:

* **macOS**: Big Sur (11.2.3) and Monterey (12.3.1)
* **Linux**: Ubuntu 18.04

#### Python dependencies
Analyses use standard Python scientific computing packages (specific versions are named in the `compute_idr_params.ipynb` notebook:

* numpy - [installation guidelines](https://numpy.org/install/)
* scipy - [installation guidelines](https://scipy.org/install/)
* matplotlib - [installation guidelines](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)

Additionally, you will also need the cython, [sparrow](https://github.com/holehouse-lab/sparrow), [metapredict](https://github.com/idptools/metapredict) and [shephard](https://shephard.readthedocs.io/) packages. These packages can be installed using `pip`:

	pip install cython
	pip install metapredict
	pip install shephard
	pip install git+https://github.com/holehouse-lab/sparrow.git

As mentioned, for a more detailed discussion of setting up a working conda environment see `code/readme.md`.
