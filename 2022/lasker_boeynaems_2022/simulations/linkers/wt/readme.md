## Summary

**Fig. 2e,f**

Simulations run on wildtype PopZ linker


## Contents

`DSSP_H.csv` - per-residue helicity value, as calculated by the DSSP algorithm

`RG.csv` - per-conformation radius of gyration (in Angstroms). n = 26,847

`end_to_end.csv` - upper-triangle of average inter-residue CA-CA distances (in Angstroms). Scaling maps (Fig. 7B) are generated as the ratio of the true distance map divided by the AFRC distance map (below).


`full.pdb` - topology PDB file of full-length PopZ

`subtraj.xtc` - sub-sampled trajectory of 5000 conformations, the full (37,200) conformation ensemble is available on literally any request, reasonable or otherwise [it's just too big for GitHub].
