# Figure 5
The notebooks in this directory fully reproduce the figures and panels in figure 5.

Note that the file `build_re_track.ipynb` constructs the file `shprd_re_vector_track.tsv`, but we do provide a compressed version (`shprd_re_vector_track.tsv.tgz`) so that all figures can be rebuilt without needing to recompute the proteome-wide re vectors!

Specifically, to uncompress simply run

	tar -xzvf shprd_re_vector_track.tsv.tgz
	
On mac and linux to extract the `shprd_re_vector_track.tsv` code out.
