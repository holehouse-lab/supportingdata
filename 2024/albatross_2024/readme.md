## Colab notebooks
We have a separate repository for our Colab notebooks, which can be found here:

[https://github.com/holehouse-lab/ALBATROSS-colab](https://github.com/holehouse-lab/ALBATROSS-colab). 

If there's a particular feature, analysis, or utility you wish we provided please don't hesitate to let us know by email and we'll try and oblige by providing this!

## Content

### 1. `/manuscript`
This directory contains jupyter notebooks for performing all the analysis in the ALBATROSS paper and reproducing the figures therein.

### 2. `/simulations`
This directory contains sequences and simulation-derived ensemble properties used for training and validation in developing ALBATROSS.

### 3. `/bonus_data`
This directory contains extra bonus information we have generated. This will be extended as new things are added, but rightw now includes includes:

1. Complete human IDR-ome for all isoforms and all reviewed/unreviewed human proteins (~100K human proteins and ~140K IDRs).
