# SJF data

Directory here describes how we build SGD-derived abundance information from the Fried lab (SJF).

These data are then used in generating the panels associated with figure 3. Specifically:

* Protein abundance (median abundance, as per [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29361465/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29361465/)
* Fraction disorder, as calculated using metapredict with domain thresholding.
* Number of domains, where domains are defined in terms of ECOD domains as per [https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003926](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003926)
