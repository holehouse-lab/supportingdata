## Step 1: Build domains from proteome

* Build domains using methd


## Step 2: Analyze with FINCHES
Next we will analyze the solvent accessible residues on the surfaces of each domain using FINHES.

The input of this analysis is an individual PDB file for each domain (with whatever domain definition procedure was defined) and the output is a SHEPHARD Domains file
