# Keywords which define how the underlying hamiltonian (energy function) behaves. This is where we define
# how the system behaves. For general simulations see the documentation (specifically the PARAMETERS section) for standard
# setups depending on the atomistic forcefield being used with ABSINTH. 
#
# All FMCSC_SC_ terms are scaling factors for some underlying component. To save space I'm not going to
# write "scaling factor for..." for each one, but instead just have ...<words>
#
# Some other accronyms
# LJ   - Lennard Jones
# ES   - Electrostatic

# There should be *NO NEED* to change any of this!!!
