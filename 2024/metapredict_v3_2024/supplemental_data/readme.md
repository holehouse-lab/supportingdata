# Supplemental data

## Document S2. 

File containing organism ID (Uniprot Proteome ID) and corresponding fraction of disorder and classification as ‘Virus’, ‘Archaea’, ‘Eukaryote’, or ‘Bacteria’ for all 23,129 proteomes predicted by metapredict V3 for this paper as a .tsv file. The fraction of disorder includes per protein and total proteome (see Materials and Methods: Average fraction of disorder across proteome comparisons for details).

## Document S3. 

File containing Proteome ID, organism name, lineage (from Uniprot) and and corresponding fraction of disorder for all 23,129 proteomes predicted by metapredict V3 for this paper as a .tsv file. The fraction of disorder includes per protein and total proteome (see Materials and Methods: Average fraction of disorder across proteome comparisons for details).

## Document S4. 

File containing the disorder values used in the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 2A as a .csv file. 

## Document S5. 

File containing the disorder values used in the phylogenetic tree in Supplemental Fig. 6A as a .csv file.
