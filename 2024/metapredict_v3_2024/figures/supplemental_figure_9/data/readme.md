# About
These two files are [SHEPHARD domain files](https://shephard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shephard_file_types.html#domain-files) with either all IDRs in the human proteome or all IDRs in human transcription factors annotated using metapredict V3.

These files were generated using the `final_human_TF_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
