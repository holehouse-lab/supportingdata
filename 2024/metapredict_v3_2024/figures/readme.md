# Please read before trying to run the notebooks!

## CAID2 dataset!!!

You will need to download the CAID2 dataset in order to run the notebooks in the following folders:
* Figure_1A_1B
* supplemental_figure_3
* supplemental_figure_4
* supplemental_figure_7

To download the CAID dataset, use this link:

https://caid.idpcentral.org/assets/sections/challenge/static/predictions/2/predictions.zip

  
Once downloaded, you will need to unzip the 'predictions.zip' file and place the 'predictions folder' into the folder that you are trying to run the analysis in. Massive aplogies for this, but Github wasn't keen on my uploading all of the CAID data because it was too large of a file.
